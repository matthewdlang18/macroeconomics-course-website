# GitHub Pages Deployment Guide

This document provides instructions for deploying this site to GitHub Pages.

## Prerequisites

- A GitHub account
- Git installed on your local machine
- Basic knowledge of Git commands

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Ensure the Repository is Properly Set Up

- Make sure the `.nojekyll` file exists in the root directory
- Ensure `.gitignore` is properly configured to exclude node_modules and other unnecessary files

### 2. Configure GitHub Pages in Repository Settings

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click on "Settings"
3. Scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section
4. Under "Source", select the branch you want to deploy (usually `main` or `master`)
5. Click "Save"

### 3. Check Build Progress

1. After saving, GitHub will start building your site
2. Go to the "Actions" tab to monitor the build progress
3. Look for the "pages build and deployment" workflow
4. If there are any errors, click on the workflow to see detailed logs

### 4. Troubleshooting Common Issues

If your site fails to build, check for these common issues:

- **Large files**: GitHub Pages has a file size limit of 100MB
- **Node modules**: Make sure node_modules directories are not committed
- **Path issues**: Ensure all file paths are correct (case-sensitive)
- **Build timeout**: Simplify your site if the build is timing out

### 5. Accessing Your Deployed Site

Once successfully deployed, your site will be available at:
`https://[username].github.io/[repository-name]/`

## Maintaining Your Site

- Always test changes locally before pushing to GitHub
- Use the `.nojekyll` file to bypass Jekyll processing if you're not using Jekyll features
- Keep your repository clean by following good Git practices
