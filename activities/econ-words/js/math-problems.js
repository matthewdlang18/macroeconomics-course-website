        answer: 500,
        solution: 'C = 100 + 0.8(500) = 100 + 400 = 500',
        explanation: 'The consumption function C = 100 + 0.8Y shows that consumption depends on autonomous consumption (100) plus a fraction of income (0.8Y). When income is 500, consumption equals 100 + 0.8(500) = 100 + 400 = 500.',
